# Notes 

## 3.4 Birthday Invite Project
The only thing i could not fully remember was how the anchor tag worked, it was mainly becasue I did not remember to have text in between the <a href=""></a>, and then of course there was no hypertext on the page.

# 4.3 HTML Porfolio Project
I did not remember how to set the height and width on images. but those are just attributes like <a href="link" alt="some alt text" width="200" height="200"
